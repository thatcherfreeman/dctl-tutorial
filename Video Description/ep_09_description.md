In this final tutorial, I cover ten DCTL coding tips I've figured out over my years coding DCTLs to help you debug and organize your code. Even if you've skipped some of the other episodes or found them too basic, I would strongly recommend watching this one because there's going to be at least one useful thing in this video.
