# Highlight Rolloff: The Math

Let's start with the following function:

$$f(x) = \frac{x}{x + 1}$$

* Easy to implement
* Has a slope of 1 at $x = 0$
* Has maximum value of 1 as $x \rightarrow \infty$

If we apply this function to every channel, we can constrain a linear, unbounded input to the 0-1 range.
