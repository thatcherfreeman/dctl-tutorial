# What is a color space?

Color spaces consist of two sets of specifications:
1. Transfer Function - Function that maps between Code Values and Linear Light (either luminance of your display, or luminance of the scene that was captured)
2. Color Primaries - CIE 1931 x,y coordinates for the Red, Green, Blue, and White points, IE the chromaticity coordinates corresponding to pure red/green/blue and to white (1, 1, 1)
