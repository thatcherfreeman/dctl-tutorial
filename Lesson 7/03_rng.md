# Random Number Generator

* Function that takes in a seed and spits out a number at uniform between 0.0 and 1.0
* I don't know enough about number theory to implement a random number generator from scratch, but you don't need to either.

    * I'll recommend **xorshift** because it's really easy to implement and works well.
