# Mid-Gray Preserving Linear Contrast

* As we know, the function $f(x) = x^\gamma$ is stationary $(f(x) = x)$ when $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.
* We'll use the trick from Lesson 6 that given mid gray $M$, we can instead apply:

$$g(x) = M \left(\frac{x}{M}\right)^\gamma$$

* To create split toning, we will have a different value of $\gamma$ for each channel.
